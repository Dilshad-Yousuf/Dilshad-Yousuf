**A little more about me:**

I'm a 5th-semester Computer Science student deeply fascinated by the potential of decentralized technologies and artificial intelligence. My current focus lies in developing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, exploring blockchain development, and applying AI/ML to solve real-world problems.

I'm proficient in Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and WordPress development. I also have basic-intermediate skills in Android development and am constantly expanding my skillset.  I believe in the power of open-source collaboration and am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow.

**Current Interests:**

*   Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
*   Blockchain Development & Web3
*   Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
*   Decentralized Applications (dApps)
*   Web Development (WordPress)
*   Android Development
